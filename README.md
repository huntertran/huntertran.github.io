# [huntertran.github.io](https://huntertran.github.io/)
My CV as a page on Github. Developed using Vuejs front-end framework, vuetify for layout, Axios to fetch data from Github API

This repository only contained the built code from [https://github.com/huntertran/cv](https://github.com/huntertran/cv) as a submodule of that repository. User page on Github only allow code from `master` branch, that's why I use the submodule approach.
